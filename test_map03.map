#These comments are written by an idiot for idiots so
#that making maps like this can be somewhat manageable.
#I do not suggest making maps in this format, and to
#have a level editor built to do so eaiser.

#Everything included is from what I have learned after
#crashing python's kernel over and over in order to guess
#the syntax. In case you haven't guessed yet, pound is the
#comment sign.

#SYNTAX: PROP_ID;PROP_Z;VECTOR2_POS;VECTOR2_SCALE;TILING
#It appears that a few things are required for a level to
#load. First being a player (first under the player heading),
#and second being a chest (first under the entities heading).

#The player position is where the movable player is placed,
#but a static animation copy is always placed around 0,50,
#which is hard coded into the game file right now.

#The first item is the background, with z of 5, moving slower
#than the z=10 of everything else. The second item is the floor,
#set to tile in a 32x32 pattern over 512 pixels

#Item ID's are located within the database DAT file, which
#contains the class, size, text identifier, and collsions
#(though collisions only seem to be specified for two of them).
#Note that this text identifier MUST match the file name for the
#texture. Also, Players seem to default to coin as their starting
#image. The current animation texture is also smaller than the
#hitbox, and so the player can hit walls that are noticeably
#infront of them

#Everything is loaded in order, so that things that share a
#Z-depth will be drawn so that the last item appears in front
#of the others.
